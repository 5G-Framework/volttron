The platform agent exposes the volttron platform to a volttron central
instance.  The volttron central instances can then start, stop, install, and
run methods on agents on this volttron platform.

JSON configuration options are as follows:

    Required Configuration
    -----------------------

    A volttron_central_vip_address should contain the vip_address location that
    the volttron central agent is running.

    "volttron_central_vip_address": "ipc://@/tmp/v1home/run/vip.socket"

    Optional Configuration
    -----------------------

    The volttron_central_vip_identity allows the customization of the volttron
    central identity from within the volttron central vip address.

    "volttron_central_vip_identity": "volttron.central";

    The agentid does not have to be unique.  It is what will be used
    as a human readable name on volttron central.  If it is not set the
    default 'platform' will be used.

    "agentid": "platform",

    The agent type in the future will allow the aggregation of agents of a
    specific type across all of the platforms within volttron central.

    "agent_type": "platform",

    The vip_identity is how the platform agent will be known within a specific
    volttron instance.  This should not be set in general as it is set
    internally to a known name "platform.agent" which is guaranteed to be
    unique within a vip_address network.

    "vip_identity": "platform.agent",
